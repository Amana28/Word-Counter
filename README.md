# Word-Counter-
A word counting program which uses a binary search tree to printout a sorted list of all the words in a text file and the number of times they appear. 














This program reads through a text document one word at a time and then does the following
  - Converts each word to lower-case (it is not case sensitive)
  - Removes any non-alphabetical  

It then keeps track of each word using a Hashmap (key-value pairs) to keep track of each word and the number of time they appear.
